/*OOPs - Classes and Objects 

C++ - initially called C with classes by stroustroupclass - extension of structures in C
structures and limitations 
     members are public
     No methods
     functions are not well maintained 
Classes = stucture + more // extension of stuctures 
classes = can have methods and properties
classes = can make few members as private and few as public
structres in C++ are typedef
You can declare objects along with the class declation like 
        class employee{
            //class defination
        }anshi,archi,amogh;

anshi.salary = makes no sense if salary is private member of the class
